"""llama.cpp / llama-swap provider profile (user plugin).

Registers the ``llamacpp`` provider so llama.cpp endpoints - a bare
``llama-server`` or a llama-swap proxy in front of one - get their own
profile instead of riding the generic ``custom`` profile. The bundled
``custom`` profile lists ``llamacpp`` among its aliases; user plugins
register after bundled ones (last-writer-wins), so the self-claimed
``llamacpp`` alias below repoints that lookup at this profile. Removing
this plugin directory restores stock resolution to ``custom``.

Skeleton stage: registration and identity only. Server probing,
reasoning-control emission, and discovery hooks land in later tasks.
